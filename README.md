# Jukebox the Post

Hi all, here's some code that you can use to make your computer or television into a picture frame for all of your favorite tumblr blogs. 

To use it you'll need:

1. A tumblr account
2. A consumer api key from here https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps
3. And a tiny bit of programming knowledge.

Clone this project. Edit your API key into the 'javascript/sketchy.js' file where it says 'UR_API_KEY'. Start an HTTP server in the main directory... `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` is easy if you have python set up.

When you navigate your computer to wherever the server is serving the project (127.0.0.1:8000 if you used the default python server), the site should be available.

Enter some blogs using the button in the top left and you're off to the races!
